# C-Event-Loop
A Event Loop in C, I bet you didn't expect this by the name at all.

## How does it work?

- poll(), yeah, that's it.

## How to run

```bash
make && ./server_loop
````

Then connect using `telnet`, or your custom chaos client:

```bash
telnet localhost 8090
```

### Why tho?

Because:

* JOBLESS.

## Disclaimer

* This isn't production-ready.
* Meant for learning.
